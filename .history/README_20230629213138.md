## Collect and analyze products on Shopee e-commerce platform

<hr />

``Along with the development of e-commerce platforms in Vietnam in recent years. I want to collect data and analyze products so that we can discover the product's price distribution, distribution of quantity sold, and rating of product``

## Tools usage
- selenium, BeautifulSoup, chromedriver for crawl data in website
- numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for EDA process

## Flow
1. Collecting
- Collect links of product on Shopeeâ€™s search page
- Access each link into list to get the necessary data

2. Cleaning
- Fill missing value 
- Cleaning data in some field 

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
